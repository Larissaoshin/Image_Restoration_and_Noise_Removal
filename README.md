## Enhancing Visual Quality in Digital Photography using Image Restoration and Noise Removal Techniques

In the age of smartphone photography and digital images, It's essential to have high-quality visuals that are critical for personal, professional, and commercial use. However, images usually suffer from various degradations such as motion blur, salt-and-pepper noise, and grainy textures due to poor illumination, camera shake, low-quality sensors, or environmental interference or disturbance. These distortions compromise the quality, visual appeal and usability of images, especially in areas like journalism, medical imaging, e-commerce, and historical archiving. This project aims to explore and apply traditional image restoration and noise removal techniques to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs.
